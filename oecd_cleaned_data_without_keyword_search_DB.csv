Subsequent flooding in the Indus deserts the following year also showed how vulnerable the country is to climate instability. A call for new research will advance knowledge about the key impacts of climate variability on agricultural productivity, and water and food security in Pakistan.In 2010, the world's largest contiguous irrigation system, the Indus basin, experienced severe rainfall and an unanticipated increase in river flow. Multiple institutional failures in flood and post-flood relief compounded the situation. In 2011, this highly regulated river system hindered drainage from flooding in the Sindh deserts into the Indus. In both cases, the vulnerabilities of Pakistan's poorest residents - those living in the Indus floodplains or on the edges of its deserts - received little attention. IDRC is supporting three research partners from a competitive call for proposals.  Researchers from the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Lahore University of Management Sciences, and Social Policy and Development Centre will address critical knowledge gaps in understanding climate-related hazards in the Indus Basin as well as the implications for marginalized communities and particularly poor women within these communities.Research will also examine vulnerability based on gender, farmers' decision-making in water stressed regions, and the wider political and economic context underpinning adaptation policy and planning. Research outputs will include peer reviewed publications, policy briefs, and technical reports. The findings will also contribute to climate change policies and national and local adaptation action plans in Pakistan. The research teams will conduct consultative dialogues and key stakeholder meetings. They will support young researchers through workshops on research methodologies, development of communication tools, and access to learning opportunities.",NA,1,"Significant",1289

Hard structures like sea walls are ineffective in mud-coasts, expensive and unable to adapt to climate change. They fail to provide the economic, environmental and social services that healthy ecosystems offer. Using a Building with Nature approach and learning from GIZ experience in Vietnam, we combine ecosystem based solutions like mangrove restoration with engineering.

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,"Significant",20459

Leading change on climate change adaptationFive consortium partners will implement the project in six countries: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Pakistan, Senegal, Tajikistan, and Tanzania. These countries all have large, economically crucial semi-arid lands, where water scarcity shapes ecosystems and social and economic opportunities.The partners include:-Overseas Development Institute -Innovations-Environnement et Développement en Afrique-Center for Climate Change Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam -Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics -Sustainable Development Policy InstituteA vision for the futureThe consortium's vision of climate-resilient development includes development that tackles poverty and maximizes people's capacity to adapt to climate change, while also expecting that change is needed to implement this vision. The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands.

Lack of water security in India Cities across South Asia face extreme water insecurity due to a changing climate and rapid urbanization. The cumulative impacts of urbanization and climate include flooding and water shortages within city boundaries and surrounding catchments. There are serious short- and long-term consequences on human health, physical assets, economic development, and social systems. Cities are not closed systems. In most cases, city-centric responses alone are inadequate. To work, adaptive climate-proof integrated urban water management must extend throughout the whole catchment, an approach known as integrated water resource management. This approach promotes coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, maximizing equitable economic and social welfare without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems. In the urban context, this also means increasing the climate resilience of homes and industries. Adaptation through innovation The project work will take place in two mid-sized Indian cities and their surrounding catchments: Solapur District, Maharashtra State and Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh State. Both face increasingly frequent drought and flood-related impacts, as well as water-use conflicts. The research team will identify and pilot specific interventions, which in turn will help build the cities' adaptive capacities. The interventions will be targeted to address the gaps and barriers that prevent city stakeholders from engaging with surrounding catchments to adopt integrated urban water management and integrated water resource management approaches. By the end of the iAdapt project, the two cities will have the tools they need to implement climate adaptation strategies through participatory planning, integrated urban water management, integrated water resource management, and access to climate finance options.",NA,1,"Not significant",20464

In India, these heat waves are exacerbated by the heat generated by human activities in urban areas. This has a considerable impact on the health of vulnerable communities, including a rise in fatalities. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, in 2015 alone more than 2,400 people died of heat-related causes. Despite projections by climate models of a warming climate and increasing frequency of extreme heat events in the coming years, in India the public recognition of the magnitude of these hazards remains low. Administrative support systems generally lack preparedness measures and data to quantify how heat stress affects human health, work productivity, and livelihoods. This project, implemented by the New Delhi-based organization Integrated Research for Action and Development, will support the development of location-specific and gender-sensitive heat stress action plans in Delhi, Bhubaneswar, and Rajkot. These plans will be based on quantitative and qualitative measures, primary and secondary data, and shared learning dialogues with stakeholders. The researchers, in collaboration with the municipal corporations, will identify the spatial vulnerability of populations during extreme heat events; analyze the impact of extreme heat events on health, work productivity, and livelihoods; select appropriate, innovative, and affordable climate adaptation measures that consider associated cost effectiveness and gender-based implications; provide training to urban planners, municipal commissioners, city engineers, officials from various healthcare centres, and municipal health officers to improve their ability to execute heat stress action plans; and organize policy workshops to facilitate the implementation of the heat stress action plans into municipal disaster strategies in the selected areas. The research process and plans developed are expected to influence appropriate adaptation actions and associated policy at the municipal scale, which will improve resilience and reduce vulnerability of more than 10 million at-risk people in the selected areas. The plans will be made available to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Indian Institute of Public Health to enable an analysis of their potential to be applied to other cities in India.",NA,1,"Significant",20493

Latin American countries have made promising progress in adaptation but still remain highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For that reason they are taking seriously their need to strengthen their capacities. Over the last two decades, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has become one of the major international bodies searching for scientific and political agreements between developing and developed countries. As a result of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, new types of commitments and responsibilities have emerged for signatory parties. The National Determined Contributions (NDCs) appear as a key instrument for outlining what will be done in terms of climate policy in each country. Several countries in Latin America are currently in the process of reviewing  their NDCs, which will eventually influence climate strategies, not only at the national level through NDCs and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) but also at the international negotiations, where developing country parties will look for support (finance, technology and capacities) for their implementation.  There are still important leadership gaps regarding the key elements essential to this implementation. Such gaps are mainly related to a lack of capacity and knowledge of climate decision-makers and negotiators.  This project is designed to fill these gaps by strengthening the capacities of climate change policy makers from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in the use of scientific evidences for the development of climate policy, negotiations and also to inform on the implementation of plans.  In order to meet these goals, the project will conduct national surveys, workshops with policy makers, negotiators and emerging leaders, virtual windows dialogue and generate scientific papers to inform NDCs and NAPs to contribute to current and upcoming UNFCCC negotiations. This project will build on work initiated in Africa, where IDRC supports scientists that inform climate negotiators. In order to enrich this mutual learning this project will also work in full synergy with the IDRC supported project # 108693 called Strengthen the use of scientific evidence to inform climate policy, negotiations and implementation in Africa by sharing experiences, best practices and expertise to stimulate interregional climate actions in the framework of the upcoming Conferences of the Parties (COPs) of the UNFCCC.",NA,1,"Not significant",20565

However, following ADB approval, the government increased tranche 2's guarantee fee to 1.20% instead of the 0.25% of tranche 1. With this higher guarantee fee, tranche 2 became at least 0.25% more expensive than the funding India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) could have raised from the domestic bond market; consequently, the loan was not signed, and ADB cancelled tranche 2 in 2016. The government, however, agreed to return the guarantee fee to 0.25% and submitted a periodic financing request letter on 6 September 2018.

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,"Significant",32943

These countries all have large, economically crucial semi-arid lands, where water scarcity shapes ecosystems and social and economic opportunities.The partners include:-Overseas Development Institute -Innovations-Environnement et Développement en Afrique-Center for Climate Change Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam -Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics -Sustainable Development Policy InstituteA vision for the futureThe consortium's vision of climate-resilient development includes development that tackles poverty and maximizes people's capacity to adapt to climate change, while also expecting that change is needed to implement this vision. The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands. The researchers will engage with business leaders, economic ministries, and regional economic communities to create new knowledge and to translate this knowledge into policies and investments. Their goal is to help reduce poverty and strengthen adaptive capacity.",NA,1,"Significant",32947

As a result of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, new types of commitments and responsibilities have emerged for signatory parties. The National Determined Contributions (NDCs) appear as a key instrument for outlining what will be done in terms of climate policy in each country. Latin American countries have made promising progress in adaptation to climate change, but they still remain highly vulnerable to its effects. For that reason, they are taking seriously their need to strengthen their capacities. Several countries in Latin America are currently reviewing their NDCs, which will eventually influence climate strategies not only at the national level through NDCs and national adaptation plans (NAPs), but also at international negotiations, where developing country parties will look for support for their implementation.  There are still important leadership gaps regarding the key elements essential to this implementation. Such gaps are mainly related to a lack of capacity and knowledge on the part of climate decision-makers and negotiators. This project is designed to fill these gaps by strengthening the capacities of climate change policymakers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay, and Uruguay in the use of scientific evidence for the development of climate policy, negotiations, and reporting on the implementation of plans. This project will build on work initiated in Africa, where IDRC supports scientists that inform climate negotiators. In order to enrich this mutual learning, this project will also work in full synergy with the IDRC-supported project called  Strengthen the use of scientific evidence to inform climate policy, negotiations, and implementation in Africa  by sharing experiences, best practices and expertise to stimulate interregional climate actions in the framework of the upcoming Conferences of the Parties of the UNFCCC.",NA,1,"Not significant",32973

A remarkable solution to this water shortage has been demonstrated by an engineer Chewang Norphel through the construction of artificial glaciers in lower altitudes which melt early in the spring when the water shortage is most critical, thus giving some water security to the population. An improved version of this concept in the form of ice cones by another engineer Sonam Wangchuk is still in the initial project stage and requires collaborations, funding, technological support, and continuous prototype improvements to ensure a better spatio-temporal coverage with the goal of providing sustainable water security to entire Ladakh region. In the proposed project, as a team of trained glaciologists, hydrologists, remote sensing specialists, atmospheric scientists, and engineers, our focus will be to address the practical issues in developing the artificial glaciers, make them more sustainable, perform site-suitability analyses, and impart technology transfer through community-based training for managing and harvesting water from them. In the first two years we will study snow physical properties in lab and in situ, and identify suitable sites through geospatial modeling to install more glaciers. In the 3rd year, we will collaborate with the local authorities to make it a community-driven approach generating water security and employment.",NA,1,"Significant",41648
