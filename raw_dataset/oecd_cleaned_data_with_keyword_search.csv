Latin American countries have made promising progress in adaptation but still remain highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For that reason they are taking seriously their need to strengthen their capacities. Over the last two decades, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has become one of the major international bodies searching for scientific and political agreements between developing and developed countries. As a result of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, new types of commitments and responsibilities have emerged for signatory parties. The National Determined Contributions (NDCs) appear as a key instrument for outlining what will be done in terms of climate policy in each country. Several countries in Latin America are currently in the process of reviewing  their NDCs, which will eventually influence climate strategies, not only at the national level through NDCs and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) but also at the international negotiations, where developing country parties will look for support (finance, technology and capacities) for their implementation.  There are still important leadership gaps regarding the key elements essential to this implementation. Such gaps are mainly related to a lack of capacity and knowledge of climate decision-makers and negotiators.  This project is designed to fill these gaps by strengthening the capacities of climate change policy makers from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in the use of scientific evidences for the development of climate policy, negotiations and also to inform on the implementation of plans.  In order to meet these goals, the project will conduct national surveys, workshops with policy makers, negotiators and emerging leaders, virtual windows dialogue and generate scientific papers to inform NDCs and NAPs to contribute to current and upcoming UNFCCC negotiations. This project will build on work initiated in Africa, where IDRC supports scientists that inform climate negotiators. In order to enrich this mutual learning this project will also work in full synergy with the IDRC supported project # 108693 called Strengthen the use of scientific evidence to inform climate policy, negotiations and implementation in Africa by sharing experiences, best practices and expertise to stimulate interregional climate actions in the framework of the upcoming Conferences of the Parties (COPs) of the UNFCCC.",NA,1,"Not significant",20565

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices.

An overview of the current disaster management plans and programs in the Philippines shows that most lack a science-based or systematic understanding of disaster risk as well as contextually driven and systematically implemented institutional preparedness. The aim of the project is to enhance the capacity of coastal cities in the Philippines to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable populations to climate-related disaster risks by supporting the preparation of the disaster risk reduction and management plans (called Resilience 2022) for Metro Manila, Iloilo and Naga. Leveraging the results of the IDRC-IRIACC Coastal Cities at Risk project (2011?2015), the research team will use a systems-oriented, cross-sectorial, transdisciplinary action and gender-sensitive research approach through a multi-stakeholder engagement platform with academic and scientific institutions, the private sector, civil society and local and national governments. Project outputs include tools that inform risk governance; an increased number of resilience scientists, professionals and leaders in risk and resilience governance; and strengthened public-private partnerships. Scientific papers, science-policy briefs and engagement with partners will result in knowledge transfer/mobilization in partnership platforms. Project outcomes include innovative solutions in climate-related disaster resilience through transdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder support in the preparation of Resilience 2022 plans, by bringing the science of climate-related disaster risk and resilience to inform the core operations of the private sector, government and civil society organizations. The project will be conducted by Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU).",NA,1,"Significant",20562

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,"Significant",32943

The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands.

Leading change on climate change adaptationFive consortium partners will implement the project in six countries: Burkina Faso, Kenya, Pakistan, Senegal, Tajikistan, and Tanzania. These countries all have large, economically crucial semi-arid lands, where water scarcity shapes ecosystems and social and economic opportunities.The partners include:-Overseas Development Institute -Innovations-Environnement et Développement en Afrique-Center for Climate Change Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam -Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics -Sustainable Development Policy InstituteA vision for the futureThe consortium's vision of climate-resilient development includes development that tackles poverty and maximizes people's capacity to adapt to climate change, while also expecting that change is needed to implement this vision. The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands. The researchers will engage with business leaders, economic ministries, and regional economic communities to create new knowledge and to translate this knowledge into policies and investments.

The programmatic approach and subprogram 1 were approved on 24 April 2014 in support of the 2013 National Power Policy of the Government of Pakistan, which seeks to build an affordable, reliable, sustainable, and secure energy sector to support the countrys economic growth. The program, fully coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under its extended fund facility, takes a phased approach over multiple years to provide dynamic, long-term support to multidimensional reforms, with subprograms that match the government s budget cycle. The IMF completed its final review of the program in September 2016. The World Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) cofinanced subprograms 1 and 2, and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) will cofinance subprogram 3, which is the third and final year of the programmatic approach and builds on the reforms initiated during previous subprograms.",NA,0.0667,"Not significant",18983

Subsequent flooding in the Indus deserts the following year also showed how vulnerable the country is to climate instability. A call for new research will advance knowledge about the key impacts of climate variability on agricultural productivity, and water and food security in Pakistan.In 2010, the world's largest contiguous irrigation system, the Indus basin, experienced severe rainfall and an unanticipated increase in river flow. Multiple institutional failures in flood and post-flood relief compounded the situation. In 2011, this highly regulated river system hindered drainage from flooding in the Sindh deserts into the Indus. In both cases, the vulnerabilities of Pakistan's poorest residents - those living in the Indus floodplains or on the edges of its deserts - received little attention. IDRC is supporting three research partners from a competitive call for proposals.  Researchers from the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Lahore University of Management Sciences, and Social Policy and Development Centre will address critical knowledge gaps in understanding climate-related hazards in the Indus Basin as well as the implications for marginalized communities and particularly poor women within these communities.Research will also examine vulnerability based on gender, farmers' decision-making in water stressed regions, and the wider political and economic context underpinning adaptation policy and planning. Research outputs will include peer reviewed publications, policy briefs, and technical reports. The findings will also contribute to climate change policies and national and local adaptation action plans in Pakistan.

In India, these heat waves are exacerbated by the heat generated by human activities in urban areas. This has a considerable impact on the health of vulnerable communities, including a rise in fatalities. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, in 2015 alone more than 2,400 people died of heat-related causes. Despite projections by climate models of a warming climate and increasing frequency of extreme heat events in the coming years, in India the public recognition of the magnitude of these hazards remains low. Administrative support systems generally lack preparedness measures and data to quantify how heat stress affects human health, work productivity, and livelihoods. This project, implemented by the New Delhi-based organization Integrated Research for Action and Development, will support the development of location-specific and gender-sensitive heat stress action plans in Delhi, Bhubaneswar, and Rajkot. These plans will be based on quantitative and qualitative measures, primary and secondary data, and shared learning dialogues with stakeholders. The researchers, in collaboration with the municipal corporations, will identify the spatial vulnerability of populations during extreme heat events; analyze the impact of extreme heat events on health, work productivity, and livelihoods; select appropriate, innovative, and affordable climate adaptation measures that consider associated cost effectiveness and gender-based implications; provide training to urban planners, municipal commissioners, city engineers, officials from various healthcare centres, and municipal health officers to improve their ability to execute heat stress action plans; and organize policy workshops to facilitate the implementation of the heat stress action plans into municipal disaster strategies in the selected areas. The research process and plans developed are expected to influence appropriate adaptation actions and associated policy at the municipal scale, which will improve resilience and reduce vulnerability of more than 10 million at-risk people in the selected areas. The plans will be made available to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Indian Institute of Public Health to enable an analysis of their potential to be applied to other cities in India.",NA,1,"Significant",20493

The Annual Learning Reviews (ALR) provide an opportunity for CARIAA partners to meet face to face and, joined by others from their stakeholder community, to take stock of progress and lessons learned to date and discuss the synthesis of results and avenues for future action. CARIAA has organized three ALRs and is now planning its fourth and final one in Cape Town in June 2018, immediately following the Adaptation Futures International Conference, where the program and its grantees will play an active role.The ALR will be hosted by the South-South-North (SSN) Institute of Cape Town, who will be awarded a grant to provide logistical support, cover travel and accommodation expenses of a number of key invited participants from consortia and collaborating programs, and to link with the lead facilitator of the event and the CARIAA team at IDRC on the ALR agenda and the planning of the sessions. The ALR will be co-funded by the budget of the four consortia. SSN will also manage the contract with a locally engaged video production company who will cover the event and help the program produce media products for dissemination and RiU purposes.The Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) aims to build the resilience of poor people to climate change by supporting a network of consortia to conduct high-calibre research and policy engagement in hot spots in Africa and Asia.
