The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year.

Africa, with rates and magnitudes of climate change above the global average, is poised to be one of the most negatively impacted regions. For example, the World Bank has suggested that more than half of the 100 million people projected to be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change by 2030 are Africans.This project supports synthesis efforts to maximize Africa's contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) sixth Assessment Report. The IPCC does not provide any financial support for these essential assessment functions, but without them the African contribution to the IPCC will be severely compromised. Since Africa is anticipated to be one of the most negatively affected regions by climate change, a detailed assessment of climate change risks and solutions is urgently needed for guiding complex decisions on climate change adaptation by governments across the continent. The overall aim of this support project is to enhance the quality, quantity, and visibility of African-focused adaptation science in the IPCC's sixth Assessment Report. By supporting Africa's contribution to the Report, this project will ensure that research conducted under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia is applied to the Report to identify risks and solutions for Africa. This project will specifically support synthesis workshops and the time of African scientists to contribute to sections of the Report. This support will develop the capacity of a new generation of African researchers to engage in international assessment processes and enhance the voice of African science in evidence for policy development.",NA,1,"Not targeted",2336

This research project will enhance CDKN's ability to connect these different initiatives, support the application of their knowledge, contribute to the sustainability of their results, and generate linkages to emerging initiatives. A key set of activities that will be supported is a series of regional workshops intended to enhance partnerships between CDKN and existing or recently closed research projects in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. The primary focus of these workshops will be to co-develop partnership proposals for impact-oriented work that will be carried out through support from CDKN. This will therefore enable CDKN to pursue a robust and transparent engagement process to identify research partners where opportunities for further impact and scalable solutions are high. Selected research partners will then engage in a co-delivery process where CDKN will offer in-kind knowledge management, communications, and engagement expertise in the delivery of different interventions, in addition to funds to support activities.
