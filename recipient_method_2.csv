In order to facilitate transfer of renewable energy from the renewable energy rich states to other states, as well as absorption and smoothing out of the intermittency from such power sources, Powergrid has identified requisite investments in a phased approach to commence during the 12th Five Year Plan.","",0,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,0,NA,"2/23/2017",1,2,"1660.5",500,"6/1/2021","12/1/2035",1.83231,159.419,NA,NA,23630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject.This subproject will provide heat to urban residents, industrial, and business customers. The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan.

An overview of each subproject is provided below. Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject.This subproject will provide heat to urban residents, industrial, and business customers. The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year. A feedstock assessment showed that only 12% of the available agriculture waste will be consumed by the biomass plant; (iii) Jinan is endowed with geothermal resources. Deep-well geothermal offers an environmentally friendly alternative to the current practice of using coal-based space heating. Deep-well reinjection technology will be used to extract and exchange heat from the underground water, which will then be filtered and recharged back to the same aquifer; and (iv) For a few newly built resident communities not covered by the heating network and where geothermal resource is not available, distributed gas-fired boilers will be used. This subproject enables Jinan to fully utilize waste heat in the neighboring regions, to form a waste heat-dominated heating system, with distributed energy supply from biomass, geothermal and natural gas as supplementary. Subproject 2: Shanghe Coal-Free Clean Heating Demonstration Subproject. This subproject covers the urban area of Shanghe County, the semi-urban area of 11 towns and 80,000 rural households where coal-fired stoves or coal-fired boilers are common for space heating.
