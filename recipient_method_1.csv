Viet Nam has been chosen as a case study due to its high vulnerability to climate-induced environmental change.It is hypothesized that better communication tools could reduce the risk of water related hazards. This hypothesis will be tested in three mid-size cities: Da Nang, Quy Nhon and Can Tho. The work will build on and complement a strong existing partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation's Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN) and the three municipal governments.Researchers will assess how different stakeholders understand climate and water-related risk; facilitate discussion between different stakeholder groups on potential response mechanisms; devise and test communication tools for disseminating information on changing climate risk and response; and inform national and local policymakers so that they can improve the implementation of adaptation programs across the country.","0",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,"",0,0,"0",0,"","",0,0,0,0,41010,0,0,0,"0","0",106

The Project will consider only retrofits of proven energy efficiency technologies in the following areas: (i) motors and motor-drive systems; (ii) transformers and reactive power compensators; (iii) lighting; (iv) heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; (v) air compressors and pumping systems; (vi) recovery of waste energy from industry; (vii) coal-fired industrial boilers and industrial cogeneration; and (viii) other related energy efficiency improvement projects.The Project will have multiple benefits: (i) energy security improves as lesser new power supply capacity will be needed to meet future demand, and less coal will be used for power generation; and (ii) the local and subregional environment improves, and the contribution to global climate change is lower because of avoided coal use.","",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,"3/30/2010",1,2,"1660.5",200,"6/1/2022","12/1/2024",0.327322,22.06,0,0,23110,0,0,0,"0","0",483

The proposed CEFP will offer three complementary financial products: (i) debt financing facility to provide entrusted loans, (ii) credit guarantee facility to leverage cofinancing, and (iii) lease financing facility for the purchase of energy efficient industrial equipment. The CEFP will partner with two commercial banks active in Shaanxi Province to offer entrusted loans, and the partner banks are encouraged to provide cofinancing to match at least the ADB loan proceeds. The guarantee facility will provide credit guarantees to technically sound subprojects with high energy-saving potential but lacking in collateral to meet the requirements of the commercial banks for the provision of cofinancing. This facility is likely to be particularly useful for ESCO and SME borrowers. The CEFP will provide credit enhancement to the guarantees provided by Shaanxi SME Financing Guarantee Company by making a cash deposit of not more than 20% of the guaranteed cofinancing loan amount in the beneficiary bank of the guarantee.

Its aim is to ensure that lending to economic activities does not come at the cost of human well-being, natural resources and vital ecosystems. In most countries, businesses and individuals do not pay for the negative environmental and social effects they cause. Hence, social and environmental risks do usually not inform the development of business plans as well as daily operations. IFC's Environmental and Social Risk Management Program (ESRM) aims to address this problem. The ESRM is based on the assumption that financial institutions (FIs) can play a key role when it comes to pushing change in the market because FIs are in a position to influence business behaviour through their ability to allocate capital by lending money to companies.","",0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,"12/31/2017",0,0,"",0,"","",0,0,0,0,41010,0,0,0,"0","0",620

This will require establishing viable community managed REDG plants, and influencing policies to ensure a regulatory framework favourable to operation and maintenance of REDG plants. Such plants shall be seen as long term investments towards the social and economic development of the region. Their integration into the grid shall allow the plant to act not only as a source of energy for local households, but also a source of revenue for local development. Through the proposed community involvement and a primary focus on household electrification, the standard of living of the communities will also be improved. In this programme, the initial focus will be on micro/mini hydro power (MHP) and biomass gasification power (BGP). The major contribution of the project will be in terms of capacity building, social engineering, and technical and policy developments.","6.6;15.a;13;11.6",0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,"12/31/2018",0,0,"",0,"","",0,0,0,0,41010,0,0,0,"","",811

Africa, with rates and magnitudes of climate change above the global average, is poised to be one of the most negatively impacted regions. For example, the World Bank has suggested that more than half of the 100 million people projected to be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change by 2030 are Africans.This project supports synthesis efforts to maximize Africa's contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) sixth Assessment Report. The IPCC does not provide any financial support for these essential assessment functions, but without them the African contribution to the IPCC will be severely compromised. Since Africa is anticipated to be one of the most negatively affected regions by climate change, a detailed assessment of climate change risks and solutions is urgently needed for guiding complex decisions on climate change adaptation by governments across the continent. The overall aim of this support project is to enhance the quality, quantity, and visibility of African-focused adaptation science in the IPCC's sixth Assessment Report. By supporting Africa's contribution to the Report, this project will ensure that research conducted under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia is applied to the Report to identify risks and solutions for Africa. This project will specifically support synthesis workshops and the time of African scientists to contribute to sections of the Report. This support will develop the capacity of a new generation of African researchers to engage in international assessment processes and enhance the voice of African science in evidence for policy development.","13",0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,2,1,"7/2/2019",0,0,"",0,"","",0,0,0,0,41010,0,0,0,"","",963

Hence, social and environmental risks do usually not inform the development of business plans as well as daily operations.
