The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year.

Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject.This subproject will provide heat to urban residents, industrial, and business customers. The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year. A feedstock assessment showed that only 12% of the available agriculture waste will be consumed by the biomass plant; (iii) Jinan is endowed with geothermal resources. Deep-well geothermal offers an environmentally friendly alternative to the current practice of using coal-based space heating. Deep-well reinjection technology will be used to extract and exchange heat from the underground water, which will then be filtered and recharged back to the same aquifer; and (iv) For a few newly built resident communities not covered by the heating network and where geothermal resource is not available, distributed gas-fired boilers will be used. This subproject enables Jinan to fully utilize waste heat in the neighboring regions, to form a waste heat-dominated heating system, with distributed energy supply from biomass, geothermal and natural gas as supplementary. Subproject 2: Shanghe Coal-Free Clean Heating Demonstration Subproject. This subproject covers the urban area of Shanghe County, the semi-urban area of 11 towns and 80,000 rural households where coal-fired stoves or coal-fired boilers are common for space heating. The subproject will use geothermal energy as the main heat source to replace coal-fired heating. Other clean options, such as air-source heat pump, are selected as distributed heating source where the pipeline network is not available. Gas-fired boilers will be","0",0.9183,"Significant",45578

Subsequent flooding in the Indus deserts the following year also showed how vulnerable the country is to climate instability. A call for new research will advance knowledge about the key impacts of climate variability on agricultural productivity, and water and food security in Pakistan.In 2010, the world's largest contiguous irrigation system, the Indus basin, experienced severe rainfall and an unanticipated increase in river flow. Multiple institutional failures in flood and post-flood relief compounded the situation. In 2011, this highly regulated river system hindered drainage from flooding in the Sindh deserts into the Indus. In both cases, the vulnerabilities of Pakistan's poorest residents - those living in the Indus floodplains or on the edges of its deserts - received little attention. IDRC is supporting three research partners from a competitive call for proposals.  Researchers from the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Lahore University of Management Sciences, and Social Policy and Development Centre will address critical knowledge gaps in understanding climate-related hazards in the Indus Basin as well as the implications for marginalized communities and particularly poor women within these communities.Research will also examine vulnerability based on gender, farmers' decision-making in water stressed regions, and the wider political and economic context underpinning adaptation policy and planning. Research outputs will include peer reviewed publications, policy briefs, and technical reports. The findings will also contribute to climate change policies and national and local adaptation action plans in Pakistan. The research teams will conduct consultative dialogues and key stakeholder meetings. They will support young researchers through workshops on research methodologies, development of communication tools, and access to learning opportunities.",NA,1,"Significant",971

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,"Significant",19836

In India, these heat waves are exacerbated by the heat generated by human activities in urban areas. This has a considerable impact on the health of vulnerable communities, including a rise in fatalities. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, in 2015 alone more than 2,400 people died of heat-related causes. Despite projections by climate models of a warming climate and increasing frequency of extreme heat events in the coming years, in India the public recognition of the magnitude of these hazards remains low. Administrative support systems generally lack preparedness measures and data to quantify how heat stress affects human health, work productivity, and livelihoods. This project, implemented by the New Delhi-based organization Integrated Research for Action and Development, will support the development of location-specific and gender-sensitive heat stress action plans in Delhi, Bhubaneswar, and Rajkot. These plans will be based on quantitative and qualitative measures, primary and secondary data, and shared learning dialogues with stakeholders. The researchers, in collaboration with the municipal corporations, will identify the spatial vulnerability of populations during extreme heat events; analyze the impact of extreme heat events on health, work productivity, and livelihoods; select appropriate, innovative, and affordable climate adaptation measures that consider associated cost effectiveness and gender-based implications; provide training to urban planners, municipal commissioners, city engineers, officials from various healthcare centres, and municipal health officers to improve their ability to execute heat stress action plans; and organize policy workshops to facilitate the implementation of the heat stress action plans into municipal disaster strategies in the selected areas. The research process and plans developed are expected to influence appropriate adaptation actions and associated policy at the municipal scale, which will improve resilience and reduce vulnerability of more than 10 million at-risk people in the selected areas. The plans will be made available to the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Indian Institute of Public Health to enable an analysis of their potential to be applied to other cities in India.",NA,1,"Significant",19853

An overview of the current disaster management plans and programs in the Philippines shows that most lack a science-based or systematic understanding of disaster risk as well as contextually driven and systematically implemented institutional preparedness. The aim of the project is to enhance the capacity of coastal cities in the Philippines to increase the resilience of the most vulnerable populations to climate-related disaster risks by supporting the preparation of the disaster risk reduction and management plans (called Resilience 2022) for Metro Manila, Iloilo and Naga. Leveraging the results of the IDRC-IRIACC Coastal Cities at Risk project (2011?2015), the research team will use a systems-oriented, cross-sectorial, transdisciplinary action and gender-sensitive research approach through a multi-stakeholder engagement platform with academic and scientific institutions, the private sector, civil society and local and national governments. Project outputs include tools that inform risk governance; an increased number of resilience scientists, professionals and leaders in risk and resilience governance; and strengthened public-private partnerships. Scientific papers, science-policy briefs and engagement with partners will result in knowledge transfer/mobilization in partnership platforms. Project outcomes include innovative solutions in climate-related disaster resilience through transdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder support in the preparation of Resilience 2022 plans, by bringing the science of climate-related disaster risk and resilience to inform the core operations of the private sector, government and civil society organizations.

Latin American countries have made promising progress in adaptation but still remain highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. For that reason they are taking seriously their need to strengthen their capacities. Over the last two decades, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has become one of the major international bodies searching for scientific and political agreements between developing and developed countries. As a result of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, new types of commitments and responsibilities have emerged for signatory parties. The National Determined Contributions (NDCs) appear as a key instrument for outlining what will be done in terms of climate policy in each country. Several countries in Latin America are currently in the process of reviewing  their NDCs, which will eventually influence climate strategies, not only at the national level through NDCs and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) but also at the international negotiations, where developing country parties will look for support (finance, technology and capacities) for their implementation.  There are still important leadership gaps regarding the key elements essential to this implementation. Such gaps are mainly related to a lack of capacity and knowledge of climate decision-makers and negotiators.  This project is designed to fill these gaps by strengthening the capacities of climate change policy makers from Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in the use of scientific evidences for the development of climate policy, negotiations and also to inform on the implementation of plans.  In order to meet these goals, the project will conduct national surveys, workshops with policy makers, negotiators and emerging leaders, virtual windows dialogue and generate scientific papers to inform NDCs and NAPs to contribute to current and upcoming UNFCCC negotiations. This project will build on work initiated in Africa, where IDRC supports scientists that inform climate negotiators. In order to enrich this mutual learning this project will also work in full synergy with the IDRC supported project # 108693 called Strengthen the use of scientific evidence to inform climate policy, negotiations and implementation in Africa by sharing experiences, best practices and expertise to stimulate interregional climate actions in the framework of the upcoming Conferences of the Parties (COPs) of the UNFCCC.",NA,1,"Not targeted",19898

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,"Significant",32552

As a result of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, new types of commitments and responsibilities have emerged for signatory parties. The National Determined Contributions (NDCs) appear as a key instrument for outlining what will be done in terms of climate policy in each country. Latin American countries have made promising progress in adaptation to climate change, but they still remain highly vulnerable to its effects. For that reason, they are taking seriously their need to strengthen their capacities. Several countries in Latin America are currently reviewing their NDCs, which will eventually influence climate strategies not only at the national level through NDCs and national adaptation plans (NAPs), but also at international negotiations, where developing country parties will look for support for their implementation.  There are still important leadership gaps regarding the key elements essential to this implementation. Such gaps are mainly related to a lack of capacity and knowledge on the part of climate decision-makers and negotiators. This project is designed to fill these gaps by strengthening the capacities of climate change policymakers from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay, and Uruguay in the use of scientific evidence for the development of climate policy, negotiations, and reporting on the implementation of plans. This project will build on work initiated in Africa, where IDRC supports scientists that inform climate negotiators. In order to enrich this mutual learning, this project will also work in full synergy with the IDRC-supported project called  Strengthen the use of scientific evidence to inform climate policy, negotiations, and implementation in Africa  by sharing experiences, best practices and expertise to stimulate interregional climate actions in the framework of the upcoming Conferences of the Parties of the UNFCCC.",NA,1,"Not targeted",32574

Africa, with rates and magnitudes of climate change above the global average, is poised to be one of the most negatively impacted regions. For example, the World Bank has suggested that more than half of the 100 million people projected to be pushed into extreme poverty by climate change by 2030 are Africans.This project supports synthesis efforts to maximize Africa's contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) sixth Assessment Report. The IPCC does not provide any financial support for these essential assessment functions, but without them the African contribution to the IPCC will be severely compromised. Since Africa is anticipated to be one of the most negatively affected regions by climate change, a detailed assessment of climate change risks and solutions is urgently needed for guiding complex decisions on climate change adaptation by governments across the continent. The overall aim of this support project is to enhance the quality, quantity, and visibility of African-focused adaptation science in the IPCC's sixth Assessment Report. By supporting Africa's contribution to the Report, this project will ensure that research conducted under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia is applied to the Report to identify risks and solutions for Africa. This project will specifically support synthesis workshops and the time of African scientists to contribute to sections of the Report.

Hard structures like sea walls are ineffective in mud-coasts, expensive and unable to adapt to climate change. They fail to provide the economic, environmental and social services that healthy ecosystems offer. Using a Building with Nature approach and learning from GIZ experience in Vietnam, we combine ecosystem based solutions like mangrove restoration with engineering. With our multi-stakeholder approach we build safe coastlines that adapt to sea level rise and simultaneously introduce sustainable land uses for prosperity.

One demonstration will be an introduction of innovative storm water management systems. Urban development increases storm water runoff by cutting trees and covering grounds with concrete or asphalt. Innovative storm water management systems reduce peak storm water runoff by promoting storm water infiltration into soil and increasing storm water retention. The demonstration and the river basin model can be replicated in other many similar-sized river basins, particularly where development is anticipated. Potential climate change impact assessment and sensitivity analysis of flood control structures  capacities will be conducted based on climate change modeling. The use of sensitivity analysis to examine potential climate change impacts and risks of flood control structures can be also replicated to other projects. The project will help XCG review Xinyu City Master Plan for 2008 6 2030 and revisit city s infrastructure planning, which will be another ADB s value addition. The project is consistent with (i) a decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in Beijing in November 2013, which supports construction of eco-civilization and establishment of a system to protect ecological environment; (ii) ADB s recommendations for preparation of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan of the People s Republic of China (PRC), 2016 2020, and ADB s upcoming Country Partnership Strategy for the PRC, 2016 2020, which supports or seems to support improvement of water security; (iii) ADB s strategy 2020 and the midterm review of the strategy that prioritize natural resource management; , and (iv) ADB s Water Operational Plan, 2011 2020 which prioritizes integrated water resources management and efficiency and productivity in the delivery of water services.

These countries all have large, economically crucial semi-arid lands, where water scarcity shapes ecosystems and social and economic opportunities.The partners include:-Overseas Development Institute -Innovations-Environnement et Développement en Afrique-Center for Climate Change Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam -Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics -Sustainable Development Policy InstituteA vision for the futureThe consortium's vision of climate-resilient development includes development that tackles poverty and maximizes people's capacity to adapt to climate change, while also expecting that change is needed to implement this vision. The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands. The researchers will engage with business leaders, economic ministries, and regional economic communities to create new knowledge and to translate this knowledge into policies and investments.

At both levels, government officials saw oil palm as a main driver of economic development. In many places, there were substantial opportunities to expand production without clearing more forest, both by increasing yields per hectare and using land already cleared of forest. In Berau District, 190,000 ha of land area was designated for conversion to oil palm plantation, of which 60% was currently forested. Conversion could result in up to 100 million tons of carbon emissions.

These countries all have large, economically crucial semi-arid lands, where water scarcity shapes ecosystems and social and economic opportunities.The partners include:-Overseas Development Institute -Innovations-Environnement et Développement en Afrique-Center for Climate Change Studies at the University of Dar es Salaam -Grantham Research Institute at London School of Economics -Sustainable Development Policy InstituteA vision for the futureThe consortium's vision of climate-resilient development includes development that tackles poverty and maximizes people's capacity to adapt to climate change, while also expecting that change is needed to implement this vision. The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands. The researchers will engage with business leaders, economic ministries, and regional economic communities to create new knowledge and to translate this knowledge into policies and investments. Their goal is to help reduce poverty and strengthen adaptive capacity.",NA,1,"Significant",32556

A remarkable solution to this water shortage has been demonstrated by an engineer Chewang Norphel through the construction of artificial glaciers in lower altitudes which melt early in the spring when the water shortage is most critical, thus giving some water security to the population. An improved version of this concept in the form of ice cones by another engineer Sonam Wangchuk is still in the initial project stage and requires collaborations, funding, technological support, and continuous prototype improvements to ensure a better spatio-temporal coverage with the goal of providing sustainable water security to entire Ladakh region. In the proposed project, as a team of trained glaciologists, hydrologists, remote sensing specialists, atmospheric scientists, and engineers, our focus will be to address the practical issues in developing the artificial glaciers, make them more sustainable, perform site-suitability analyses, and impart technology transfer through community-based training for managing and harvesting water from them. In the first two years we will study snow physical properties in lab and in situ, and identify suitable sites through geospatial modeling to install more glaciers. In the 3rd year, we will collaborate with the local authorities to make it a community-driven approach generating water security and employment.",NA,1,"Significant",41447
