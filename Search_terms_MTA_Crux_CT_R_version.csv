Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,Significant,20459

The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development.

Co-developed by the Rainforest Alliance, major Mexican producer associations, and leading Mexican and global agribusiness and forest products companies, the proposed activity will harness the core competencies of each partner to ensure long-term local capacity and market demand for forest conservation.",NA,1,Not significant,43258

Many residents along the deltas live in poverty and depend on livelihoods that are sensitive to a changing climate. This research project will examine the issue. Specifically, it will assess migration as a climate change adaptation option in delta areas dealing with a changing climate. It will also deliver policy support to create the conditions for sustainable adaptation which respond to both men's and women's needs.Why migration?Migration is a common adaptation strategy used to cope with environmental and economic change in deltas. It can increase the ability of migrant households to recover quickly from illness, change, or misfortune. However, it can also perpetuate the vulnerability of people left behind or in locations of temporary or permanent resettlement. The impacts men and women experience differ. Project area and teamThe project area covers four deltas: the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh and India, the Nile delta in Egypt, the Mahanadi delta in India, and the Volta delta in Ghana. A consortium of five institutions with expertise in the different regions will conduct the research. They will study migration in deltas in Africa and South Asia to inform policy on the potential role it can play in promoting sustainable options to adapt to a changing climate.Different impacts of climate changeClimate change has various types of impacts in these regions: biophysical, economic, political, and social. The research teams will assess how different types of impacts and drivers of change affect vulnerability in deltas. They will evaluate the different impacts on men and women. The teams will use a model that integrates climate and socio-economic aspects to assess when migration is an appropriate adaptation option, especially for the most vulnerable. Working with stakeholders, they will also contrast migration with other available options. How the research will be usedThe research outcomes will help stakeholders rethink climate change adaptation policies and practices. The results will also serve to mobilize resources to support conditions for more sustainable temporary, periodic, or permanent migration between now and 2100.By taking a comprehensive interdisciplinary and comparative approach, this project will generate lessons on migration as an adaptation option from the local to the international levels. It will also promote knowledge-sharing across regions and continents, increasing capacity to understand the issues and articulate solutions.",NA,1,Significant,32943

The research program is designed to produce evidence that will support this change. Research methodologyThe research will identify:-different enabling factors of economic development;-where they fail to meet the needs and aspirations of poor and marginalized people;  -whether they increase people's vulnerability to climate change; and-which of these key factors might be affected by climate change and how. The researchers will take a transdisciplinary approach to assess how to resolve trade-offs between these different dimensions to support climate-resilient development. From research to policyThe research results will advise policymakers and decision-makers contemplating uncertain interactions between climate change and economic development in fragile semi-arid lands.

The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan.

The heating and cooling projects proposed are innovative, as they will combine renewable energy technologies and waste heat recovered from industry and power plants to reduce the energy and carbon intensity of heat production and refrigeration, and thereby reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the heat island effect in urban areas. An overview of each subproject is provided below. Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject.This subproject will provide heat to urban residents, industrial, and business customers. The technologies to be used on the project include: (i) Large temperature difference waste heat exchange technology is adopted for transporting waste heat from the nearby power plants to the city, which will increase the heat transport capacity by more than 50% than using the standard technology, and same time reduce electricity consumption for cycling pumps. The large temperature difference is achieved by lowering the temperature of return water to the primary pipeline. The waste heat will be used to supply heating to about 80 million m2 of buildings; (ii) Year-round heat supply needs to be provided to an industrial park with industrial and business customers located in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass briquette made of agriculture waste will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 buildings and will generate electricity of 133 GWh per year.
